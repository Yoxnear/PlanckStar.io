## 🚀 Project Structure

Feel free to explore the project, this is the structure of it.

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── icons/
│   ├──components/
│   │    └── main/
│   ├──layouts/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Components

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
